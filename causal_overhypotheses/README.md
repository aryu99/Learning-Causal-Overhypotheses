# Towards Understanding How Machines Can Learn Causal Overhypotheses (Submission: NeurIPS Baselines 2022)

This repository hosts the code for the blicket-environment baselines presented in the paper **Towards Understanding How Machines Can Learn Causal Overhypotheses**.

## Environment Details

The environment is a standard gym environment located at `envs/causal_env_v0.py`.

## Running our Benchmarks

The following details are provided for running the experiments in the paper.

### Installation and Requirements

To install the environment, we require python <= 3.7, and tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu < 2 (usually 1.15.5). This is due to a dependency on the old version of stable-baselines (the new version does not support LSTM models). Dependencies can be installed with:

```
pip install tensorflow==1.15.5 stable-baselines gym==0.21.0 protobuf==3.20 tqdm
```

### Q-Learning

To run Q-Learning experiments, use the command `python models/q_learning.py` with the correct options:

```
usage: q_learning.py [-h] [--num NUM] [--alpha ALPHA] [--discount DISCOUNT] [--epsilon EPSILON]

Train a q-learner

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --num NUM            Number of times to experiment
  --alpha ALPHA        Learning rate
  --discount DISCOUNT  Discount factor
  --epsilon EPSILON    Eepsilon-greedy exploration rate
```

### Standard RL Models

To train standard RL models, use the command `python driver.py` with the correct options:

```
usage: driver.py [-h] [--alg ALG] [--policy POLICY] [--lstm_units LSTM_UNITS]
                 [--num_steps NUM_STEPS]
                 [--quiz_disabled_steps QUIZ_DISABLED_STEPS]
                 [--holdout_strategy HOLDOUT_STRATEGY]
                 [--reward_structure REWARD_STRUCTURE]

Train a model

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --alg ALG             Algorithm to use
  --policy POLICY       Policy to use
  --lstm_units LSTM_UNITS
                        Number of LSTM units
  --num_steps NUM_STEPS
                        Number of training steps
  --quiz_disabled_steps QUIZ_DISABLED_STEPS
                        Number of quiz disabled steps (-1 for no forced
                        exploration)
  --holdout_strategy HOLDOUT_STRATEGY
                        Holdout strategy
  --reward_structure REWARD_STRUCTURE
                        Reward structure
```

Algorithm Choices: `[a2c, ppo2]`

Policy Choices: `[mlp, mlp_lstm, mlp_lnlstm]`

Holdout Strategy Choices: `[none, disjunctive_train (Only disjunctive overhypotheses), conjunctive_train (Only conjunctive overhypotheses), disjunctive_loo (Only disjunctive, leave on out), conjunctive_loo (Only conjunctive, leave one out), both_loo (Leave one out for both)]`

Reward Structure Choices: `[baseline (Light up the blicket detector), quiz (Determine which are blickets), quiz-type (Determine which are blickets + Causal vs. Non-Causal), quiz-typeonly (Causal vs. Non-Causal only)]`

This will produce a model output file `{model_name}.zip` based on the options that are chosen during the training process. Evaluation data is printed during the training process, and training is terminated when 3M training steps are reached.

### Decision Transformer / Behavior Cloning

Training the decision transformer consists of two (or three) steps. The first step is to generate trajectories for training. This can either be done with `scripts/collect_trajectories.py`, which has the following signature:

```
usage: collect_trajectories.py [-h] [--env ENV] [--model_path MODEL_PATH]
                               [--num_trajectories NUM_TRAJECTORIES]
                               [--max_steps MAX_STEPS]
                               [--quiz_disabled_steps QUIZ_DISABLED_STEPS]
                               [--output_path OUTPUT_PATH]

Collect Trajectories from Causal Environments

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --env ENV             Environment to use
  --model_path MODEL_PATH
                        Path to model
  --num_trajectories NUM_TRAJECTORIES
                        Number of trajectories to collect
  --max_steps MAX_STEPS
                        Maximum number of steps per trajectory
  --quiz_disabled_steps QUIZ_DISABLED_STEPS
                        Number of steps to disable quiz
  --output_path OUTPUT_PATH
                        Path to output file
```

The model path generated by the training step from the standard RL models can be passed to this script to generate samples from the pre-trained model. This will generate a file `trajectories.pkl`. This `pkl` file should be re-named to take the form `causal-<name>-v2.pkl`. This file should then be moved to the `models/decision-transformer/data` folder.

To train the decision transformer, follow the instructions in `models/decision-transformer` to install the conda environment, and then run `python experiment.py` with the options `--env causal` and a `--dataset` option corresponding to the chosen value for `<name>` above (for example, if the trajectories are named `causal-mlp-v2.pkl` the command would be `python experiment.py --env causal --dataset mlp --batch_size 128 --K 30 --model dt`). The batch size, K, and model (dt: decision transformer, bc: behavior cloning) can be adjusted as desired.
